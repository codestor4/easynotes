# WP-EasyNotes WordPress Plugin
This plugin demonstrates CRUD operations with the help of WP REST API

Video demo of this can be found here: https://d.pr/v/VwApKB

Note: This is not ready for production sites. It's a WIP.

### Usage
After the plugin is installed, create a page and add `[easynotes]` shortcode to it. That's all.
